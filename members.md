### Principal Investigator

- **Youngung Jeong**, PhD

<img src="/images/yj_profile.jpg" width="120">

I'm an assistant professor at [Changwon National University](www.changwon.ac.kr).
I am interested in mechanical behaviors of metals.
I look at crystallographic textures of polycrystalline metals using X-ray diffractometer when I need to consider the mechanical anisotropy.
I also use X-ray diffractomers for residual stress measurement.
I like to code using [Python](www.python.org) <img src='/images/python-logo@2x.png' width='140'> and [Fortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/).
Data I handle is usually visualized by [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), which is one of many scientific Python packages.
While I was an undergraduate, I learned how to write small computer programs using those languages.
One of such is [texture](https://github.com/youngung/texture), which is a collection of various python modules which I use for pole figure plotting.

[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) <img src='/images/emacs.png' width='30'> is my favorite editor and I write equations using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org). <img src='/images/latex-project-logo.svg' width='120'>

My CV is available [here](/images/cv.pdf).
