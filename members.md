<img src="/images/yj_profile.jpg" width="120">

I'm an assistant professor at [Changwon National University](www.changwon.ac.kr).
I am interested in mechanical behaviors of metals.
I look at crystallographic textures using X-ray diffractometer, which I also use for residual stress measurement.
I like to code using [Python](www.python.org), and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is my favorite editor.
My CV is available [here](/images/cv.pdf).
