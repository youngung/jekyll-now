I'm an assistant professor at [Changwon National University](http://changwon.ac.kr) <img src='/images/cwnu.png' width='80' >.
I am interested in studying mechanical behaviors of metals.
I look at crystallographic textures of polycrystalline metals using X-ray diffractometer, which also can be used to measure residual stresses.
[Python](www.python.org) <img src='/images/python-logo@2x.png' width='140'> and [Fortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/) are my two favorite languages.
Data I handle is usually visualized by [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), which is one of many scientific Python packages.
While I was an undergraduate, I learned how to write small computer programs using those languages.
One of such is [texture](https://github.com/youngung/texture), which is a collection of various python modules particuarly useeful for plotting pole figures from discrete set of orientations.

[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) <img src='/images/emacs.png' width='30'> is my favorite editor and I write equations using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org). <img src='/images/latex-project-logo.svg' width='120'>
