LAPACK (Linear Algebra Package) is a standard software library for numerical linear algebra.
It provides routines for solving systems of linear equations and linear least squares, eigenvalue problems and singular value decomposition.
Find more about it either in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK) or in [Netlib](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/).

This [page](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/LAPACK%20on%20Windows) is to give you instructions to install LAPACK on Windows on a step-by-step basis.
