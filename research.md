## Crystal plasticity

Visco-Plastic Self-Consistent crystal plasticity model (VPSC) is one of the most successfuly crystal plasticity model that is widely used in the community of material science and engineering where people seek for a way to link microscopic mechanical properties to their macroscopic counterparts.


## Phenomenological constitutive model for anisotropic polycrystalline metals

Phenomenological approach using anisotropic yield functions and simple hardening rule has been widely used both in academia and industry.
Development of accurate constitutive models for efficient yet accurate model is often required.


## Finite-Element simulations for metal forming operations

Practice of Finite Element simulation on forming operations has become a customary process prior to actual die-making process in order to reduce manufacturing cost and time.


## Residual stress measurement on the basis of X-ray diffraction

Residual stresses arise due to heat treatment and plastic deformation, which is often unwated since it may lead to prematured failure of materials.
Moreover, the same method has been used to measure quasi-static flow stress under multiaxial loading conditions where conventional measurement methods using load-cell is not applicable.
