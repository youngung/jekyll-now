title: install TeX Live on windows
---

Caution: Full installation of TeX live may take a lot of time.

You can find general instructions in [here](https://tug.org/texlive/) about TeX live.

For Korean users, you can also find more some useful instructions [here](http://wiki.ktug.org/wiki/wiki.php/설치하기Windows/tlinstall).

I'd recommend to download ISO image file instead of download the packages on-line - it is generally faster to download the ISO image.
