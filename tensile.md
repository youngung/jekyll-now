title: Uniaxial tension tests
---

-------------------------------------------
### Intro

This page is to illustrate how to process typical uniaxial tension test data.

First of all, I assume you already have Anaconda Python 2.7 installed on your system.
If you have not done it yet, install it following this [link]({% link anaconda.md %}).

-------------------------------------------
### Notebook for post-processing uniaxial tension tests

Take a look at this [link](https://github.com/youngung/plasticity_lecture/blob/master/ipynb/02_Uniaxial_tension_test_data_analysis.ipynb).

There you have two clibrations: one for width (diametral) another for axial extensometers, respectively.
Find the calibration sheet [here]({% link howtos/uniaxial/data/calib.txt %}), where you can actually find the two clibration data.

Find also the raw data files from [here]({% link howtos/uniaxial/rawdata.zip %}). In the zip file you'll have data along rolling, diagonal and transverse directions, respectively.

### Strain-hardening models

Take a look at this [page]({% link hardening.md %}).
