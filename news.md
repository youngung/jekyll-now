## 재료역학 연구실 구성원 모집 ##

창원대학교 신소재공학부 재료역학 연구실에서는 다양한 포지션의 구성원을 모집합니다.
학부생 인턴 및 대학원생을 모집합니다. 학부생 인턴의 경우 근무시간 조정 가능합니다.
두 포지션 모두 [한국연구재단](http://www.nrf.re.kr/) 연구프로젝트에 연구원으로 참여하여 소정의 인건비가 지급됩니다.
다음의 [Link]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.md %}) 를 참고하세요.

우리 연구실에서는 컴퓨터를 활용한 시뮬레이션 및 재료역학 실험을 통해
금속 재료의 기계적 특성을 파악하고 금속 판재의 성형성 향상 방법을 연구/개발합니다.
그외에도 금속의 기계적 특성과 관련한 다양한 연구를 계획중입니다.
관심있는 분들의 참여를 바랍니다.

## Openings ##

Various positions including graduate, undergraduate interships, and postdoctoral positions are available. All of the positions are fully funded by Government research projects.
Currently (as of 2018 July), Materials Mechanical Lab at CWNU are involved in three research projects funded by Korea Goverment - find more details about the projects [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.md %}).
If you are interested in, please [contact us](mailto:yjeong@changwon.ac.kr).

-----------------------------

### * POST-DOC (or fully funded PhD studentship) positions

#### We are seeking for highly motivated and independent post-doctoral scholars (or graduate students) on a long-term project aiming at developing novel composite materials that exhibit excellent thermal (and fire) performance. Those who meet the skills and experiences as listed below are encouraged to apply. Those who seek for graduate positions studying the below-mentioned subjects are also encouraged to apply. The candidates will participate in a Korea government-funded research project.

#####	1. Technical knowledges (or experiences)
+	Combustion analysis of solid structure (heat analysis, fire analysis).
+	Fire modelling and experiments to analyze and verify fire performance of composite materials (thermal properties, fire resistance, fire endurance, flammability, flame spread, smoke, structural stability, hazard analysis)
+	Solid mechanics, fluid mechanics (materials mechanics in general)

#####   2. Numerical Analysis (Modelling)
+	Finite element method, finite differential method (hands-on experience with commercial software such as Abaqus)
+	Programming skills primarily for data analysis, visualization and numerical model implementation (to name a few related languages: Python, Julia, Fortran, Matlab, R and the likes).
+	Familiarity with software development is a plus (Git, GitHub, Linux, Bash scripting, and so forth)

#####	3. Reporting skills
+	Should be fluent in English
+	Technical reporting, writing and presentation skills
